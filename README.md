#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
answer
software engineering is the application of engineering principles to develop software applications to solve user needs.
these principles follow a path or circle called the software development life cycle: requirement, analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance
################################################################

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The milestones includes
1. the development of programming languages like fortran, c#, c++, python< java etc
2. The establishment of software engineering as a disciline in the 1960.
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
4. the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
################################################################################

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases of software development life cycle includes:
1. Requirement: this phase involves the gathering of both system requirements, user requirement, hardware requirement. and the deliverable that comes out of this phase is called SRS (software requirement document).
2. Analysis: in this phase the problem is analyzed to see if it is feasible, and features needed are mapped out.
3. Design: in this phase the system design is done, both the ux and the ui, keeping the user in mind.
4. Development/coding: the designed system is developed or implemented.
5. testing: in this phase various test are carried out to make sure that the system meets up to the users needs.
6. Deployment: In this phase the developed software is deployed to the user for use.
7. maintainenace: this phase deals with the maintainenace of the developed software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. The waterfall methodology deals with the movement of sdlc in a squencial order, meaning that it flows from top to bottom, it is rigid and strict.
   while agile methodology is the combination of other development methodologies which allows for ease development by iteration.
2. changes can be made in the software been developed with agile methodology, but in waterfall, it gives no room for changes.

3. examples of scenerio where each would be appropriate
   -waterfall is used in a small application development,mainly used for learning.
   -agile is widely used for large software development, because of its rapid iteration abilities, it gives developers the priviledge to organize sprints and see where they are going .

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. software developer: software developer is the personel(s) in a team whoo is tasked with the development of the software that is writing the codes, debugging the software, and controlling the version.
2. quality assurance engineer: this are pesonnels who is incharge of monitoring the work of developers, making sure that the codes athey write is clean and the sofftware is up to standard.
3. project manager: this is a personnel who is oversees the whole work done to make sure that a project is delivered on time and on  budget, they are tasked with;
   -resource sharing
   -estimation of the time rwquired to develop a software.
   - the number of people
   - the amount of funds needed to bring a project to completion
  ###########################################################################################################################################################################################################


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs are software suites that provide tools for writing,debugging, and testing codes. (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
- version control systems: Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).
####################################################################################################################################################################

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The challenges faced by software engineers includes but not limited the following:
-changing requirement in the cause of software development.
-tight deadlines when dealing with complex software.
-technicl debts.
#################################################################################################################################################################

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing: This involves testing the individual components and module of the software.
-Integration testing: this involves testing the interaction between the different components of a software.
-System Testing: Testing the entire software as a whole.
-Acceptance Testing: this involvews testing the software to see if it meets up with the user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering can be defined as the art of fine-tunning the ai engine to give us a response that meets our needs accurately.

ipmotance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models
-helps me to determine what my goals are for using ai systems/models.
-helps me to perform tests accurately.
-separates my instructions.
-prompt engineering helps me get the best out of any ai model

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example of a vague prompt.
"How to cook soup"  
when this prompt is given to the ai model say chatgpt, it will return a generic method of cooking a generic soup i dont have in mind.
But lets say i want it to tell me how to cook egusi soup with bitterleaf, and only chicken, let say i dont want to fry the melon seed, i would have to give it this prompt.

"how to cook egusi soup with bitterleaf, and only chicken as the protein, pls the melon will not be fried". this is a more detailed prompt, it will generate A more detailed and specific answer that meets my needs.
